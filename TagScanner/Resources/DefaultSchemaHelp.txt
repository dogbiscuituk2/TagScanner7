< SCHEMA FILE SYNTAX
<
< A Schema File contains active lines of four distinct types:
< (1) Any line starting with a '<' symbol, like this one, is a comment. Otherwise...
< (2) A line that doesn't contain a '>' symbol anywhere is a "Root", and there can be at most one Root.
< (3) Lines starting with a '>' symbol represent Media Categories.
< (4) Lines containing a '>' symbol in any other position are "Filespec" lines.
< All Filespec lines immediately following any Media Category line are regarded as its children.
< Similarly, all Media Category lines are in turn regarded as children of the Root (if present).
< Doubled-up '>>' symbols indicate Filespecs that are active, i.e., selected in the application.
