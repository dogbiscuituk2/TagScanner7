< SCHEMA FILE STRUCTURE
<
< This is an example of a Schema file, a type of text file, structured as follows.
< All whitespace between lines, and at the start and end of a line, is ignored.
< Every line of a Schema file like this has one of these four types:
< 1. A line starting with the '<' symbol, like this one, is a comment. Otherwise...
< 2. A line that doesn't contain a '>' symbol anywhere is the "Root" (there can be at most one Root).
< 3. Lines starting with a '>' symbol represent Media Categories.
< 4. Lines containing a '>' symbol in any other position are "Filespec" lines.
< The doubled-up '>>' symbol indicates Filespecs that are active, i.e., selected in the application.
< All Filespec lines immediately following any Media Category line are regarded as its children.
< Similarly, all Media Category lines are in turn regarded as children of the Root (if present).
